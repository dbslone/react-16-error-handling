# React 16 Error Handling

Example application that uses a Higher Order Component(HOC) to demonstrate React 16's new method `componentDidCatch`

*Note: Must run in React in production mode otherwise development mode will catch the error and display debug information* 

To run in development mode: `npm start`
To run in production mode:
- Install serve: `npm install -g serve`
- Build and run static site: `npm run build && serve -s build`
